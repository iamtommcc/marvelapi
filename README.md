# Slate 
A nifty bunch of boilerplate that serves as a great base for front-end projects. This was created for my own personal convenience. If people *actually use this thing* I'll be sure to improve it.



Technically speaking this starter kit doesn't do much. It is essentially the bare minimum for writing modern front-end projects

* Component-friendly folder structure
* SASS, PostCSS, Autoprefixer, Browser Sync, Browserify, Babel, Normalize.css
* Globs your SASS so you don't have to keep updating `main.scss` every time you add a new component. Be careful with this though!
* All powered by Gulp.


## Installation & Usage

Requires Node & NPM. 

Clone to download the repo, navigate to it, and run `npm install`.

When you're ready to begin coding, just run `gulp`. Gulp will compile everything and keep watching.

## Configuration

Edit the `settings` constant at the top of `gulpfile.babel.js` to change paths etc.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Add some super dooper basic flexbox grid (because float grid systems are so 2014).
